## Potential problem: in Debian you have fdisk and partx available by default afaict. fdisk is 'for humans, not scripts' and partx 'is not an fdisk program â€“ adding and removing partitions does not  change  the  disk'
# 'Note  that  partx(8)  provides  a  rich interface for
# scripts  to  print  disk  layouts,  fdisk  is  mostly
# designed  for  humans.' oic

# found this janky workaround: https://superuser.com/questions/332252/creating-and-formating-a-partition-using-a-bash-script
# better yet just use sfdisk :^)
